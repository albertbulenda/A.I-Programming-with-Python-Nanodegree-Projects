# A.I-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree-Projects

Welcome to the AI programming with python Nanodegree Project! Come and explore the beautiful world of A.I

In this project we combined different topics to build an efficient Image Classifier application. These Topics include but not limited to:

# Introduction to Python
Start coding with Python, drawing upon libraries and automation scripts to solve complex problems quickly.

Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
Estimated time: 29 days

## Topic 1
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Let's focus on library packages for Python, such as : Numpy (which adds support for large data), Pandas (which is used for data manipulation and analysis) And Matplotlib (which is used for data visualization).

Estimated time: 7 hours 30 minutes 

## Topic 2
Linear Algebra Essentials
Learn the basics of the beautiful world of Linear Algebra and why it is such an important mathematical tool in the world of AI.

Estimated time: 9 hours

## Topic 3
Calculus Essentials
Estimated time: 2 hours 30 minutes

## Topic 4
Neural Networks
Estimated time: 9 hours 40 minutes

## Topic 5
Create Your Own Image Classifier
In the second and final project for this course, you'll build a state-of-the-art image classification application.
